{"prompt": "The framework comprises a pretrained dialogue model ", "completion": "(Blenderbot) and a diffusion model (Stable Diffusion) "}

{"prompt": "Consequently, an increasing number of individuals are \u2217Corresponding author \u2020Equal contribution. Figure 1: An example of interactive editing utilizing various diffusion models for a wide array of tasks, engaging in the creation of personalized images. Although image generation has ", "completion": "become increasingly accessible to the general public, other tasks, such as image editing, remain considerably challenging. This preference can be explained by the continuity of thought, as altering a portion of a scene aligns more closely with human cognition "}
{"prompt": "Current methods for semantic image editing using generative ", "completion": "models are abundant and diverse (Zhan et al., 2021) "}
{"prompt": "However, these methods often prove unsuitable for human-computer interaction or rely heavily on personal adjustments. Based on an in-depth analysis of this issue, we identified two primary limitations that significantly impact the editing performance of these models. arXiv:2303.10073v1 ", "completion": "[cs.CV] 17 Mar 2023 First, most text-to-image models struggle to process human instructions, a phenomenon we term \"instruction unfriendly.\" This arises because these models are predominantly trained on declarative sentences, making imperative sentences, such as instructions, unfamiliar to them "}
{"prompt": "Second, individuals frequently provide models with ambiguous instructions, which can lead to ", "completion": "confusion regarding sources and targets in the absence of a given image "}
{"prompt": "Some users simply employ vague phrases like \"something else\" to ", "completion": "refer to the target, which existing models find difficult to interpret "}
{"prompt": "To address these challenges, we ", "completion": "propose using dialogues to clarify instructions "}
{"prompt": "By engaging in conversation with large language models, precise commands can be extracted and subsequently employed to ", "completion": "guide image generation. In this study, we introduce a user-friendly approach to image editing through natural language conversation "}
{"prompt": "Upon providing our model with an input image, users can engage ", "completion": "in a dialogue with the model to convey their editing requirements "}
{"prompt": "Our model is capable of discerning user needs and ", "completion": "formulating a concise instruction to edit the image accordingly "}
{"prompt": "We employ two models, a dialogue model (Shuster et al., 2022) and ", "completion": "a image generation model (Rombach et al., 2022) to complete this task "}
{"prompt": "The dialogue model is used to converse with the user and, if ", "completion": "the user\u2019s input instruction is deemed ambiguous, it seeks clarification through additional questions "}
{"prompt": "Finally, the language model generates a clear instruction, which the image generation ", "completion": "model utilizes, along with the input image, to produce a new, edited image "}
{"prompt": "Since there are no suitable existing datasets for fine-tuning these two large models, we adopted the approach of selfinstruct (Wang et al., ", "completion": "2022) and generate simulated dialogues and image pairs for fine-tuning purposes. Results demonstrate that our model achieves zeroshot generalization in real-world application scenarios "}

{"prompt": "Our system receives images and editing instructions ", "completion": "from users in the form of dialogue "}
{"prompt": "The system actively solicits clarifications and provides feedback ", "completion": "and summaries to complete the dialoguebased image editing "}
{"prompt": "For this task, we first introduce ", "completion": "a multi-turn dialogue-based image editing dataset (Sec "}
{"prompt": "Then, based on the generated dataset, we ", "completion": "construct the dialogue-based image editing model (Sec "}
{"prompt": "3.2). 3.1 Construction of Dialogue and Image Editing Datasets 3.1.1 Building Dialogue Dataset The construction of the dialogue ", "completion": "and image editing datasets is shown in Figure 2, which includes Building Dialogue Dataset and Building Image Editing Dataset "}
{"prompt": "For Building Dialogue Dataset, we randomly selected image captions from CUB200-2011 (He and Peng, 2020), Microsoft COCO (Lin et al., 2014), DeepFashion (Liu ", "completion": "et al., 2016), and Flickr-Faces-HQ (FFHQ) (Karras et al., 2021b) datasets, and combined them with prompt instructions to generate the necessary dialogue data "}
{"prompt": "For Building Image Editing Dataset, we randomly selected image-text pairs from the ", "completion": "same datasets, and input the texts into text-davinci-003 to generate editing instructions "}
{"prompt": "Regarding the construction of dialogue datasets, we randomly selected 10,000 image ", "completion": "captions from four different datasets: CUB-200-2011, Microsoft COCO, DeepFashion, and FFHQ "}
{"prompt": "Using self-instruct (Wang et al., 2022), we combined these image captions with ", "completion": "prompt instructions and input them into text-davinci-003 to generate the necessary dialogue data "}
{"prompt": "The overall process of constructing the dialogue dataset is shown in Step 1 of Figure 2. As shown ", "completion": "in the example in Figure 3, we first defined a Prompt Head to describe the dialogue generation task "}
{"prompt": "Here, we instructed text-davinci003 to \"generate a dialog about a user ordering the system to edit data of the image based on the given image caption.\" ", "completion": "Then, we randomly selected 20 manually written dialogue examples from a sample library containing 500 dialogue examples, as shown in the Example section of Figure 3 "}
{"prompt": "The Example section consists of two parts: the \"Caption\" which is the input image caption, and the \"Dialog\" which is the desired ", "completion": "dialogue that includes simulating multiple rounds of conversation for modifying the image\u2019s colors, scenes, and other changes, as well as correcting fuzzy instructions "}
{"prompt": "The response generated by text-davinci-003 was used to create the desired dialogue data. Using the dialogue dataset construction method described above, we obtained a total of 10,000 Figure 2: The processing of dialogue and image editing dataset construction Figure 3: Example of Dialogue Dataset Construction dialogue data ", "completion": "samples that meet the needs of opendomain dialogue image editing, including various modifications to people, objects, backgrounds, etc. mentioned in the image captions. 3.1.2 Building Image Editing Dataset The overall process for building the image editing dataset is shown in Step 2 and Stage 2 in Figure 2 "}
{"prompt": "The process is divided into two parts: Step 2 generates image editing instructions, and Stage 2 uses ", "completion": "existing text-to-image editing models to generate edited images based on the text data generated in Step 2 "}
{"prompt": "Here, the text refers to the image caption, and we used self-instruct(Wang et al., 2022) to input ", "completion": "the prompt instructions and image captions together into the text-davinci-003 model to generate the desired text editing instructions "}
{"prompt": "The generated data was then fed into the text-to-image editing model in Stage 2 to obtain the edited images. In ", "completion": "Step 2, similar to Figure 3, we first defined a Prompt Head to describe the task of generating the dialogues "}
{"prompt": "We told the text-davinci-003 model, \"The following is the automatic generation of modification instructions ", "completion": "based on caption, as well as the generation of new sentences to add modification instructions "}
{"prompt": "Modification instructions are not limited to human ", "completion": "editing, but can be any object, anything...\" "}
{"prompt": "We then randomly selected 20 humanwritten editing instructions ", "completion": "from a sample library containing 500 editing instruction examples "}
{"prompt": "An example of such an instruction is shown in Figure 4 as \"Example\", which is divided into three parts: \"Image Caption\" as the input image caption, ", "completion": "\"Modify Instructions\" as the editing instructions for modifying anything, and \"Edited Captions\" as the output generated by using the editing instructions as prompt to modify the caption "}
{"prompt": "For example, given the image caption \"A cat laying on top of a wooden bench.\", the Modify Instructions \"Change the cat to a yellow labrador.\", the Edited Captions would be \"A yellow Labrador laying on top of a wooden bench.\" Finally, we concatenated an image caption with the Examples, inputted it into the text-davinci-003 model, and obtained the desired Modify Instructions ", "completion": "and Edited Captions data as the response. Note that we generated some datasets here for partial transformation and object isolation of images to be used for fine-tuning the model in Section 3.2.2. In Stage 2, we organize the editing instruction data generated in Step 2 and use multiple pretrained models with Image Captions, Modify Instructions, Edited Captions to generate edited images "}
{"prompt": "Inspired by previous works, we use four text-to-image editing models, including Prompt-toPrompt (Hertz et al., 2022), ", "completion": "DE-Net (Tao et al., 2022), Text2Human (Jiang et al., 2022), and StyleMC (Kocasari et al., 2022) "}
{"prompt": "As shown in Figure 2 Stage 2, Prompt-to-Prompt takes Image Figure 4: Example of Image Editing Dataset Captions and Edited Captions as input to generate the original and edited ", "completion": "images simultaneously, as it cannot directly modify the editing instruction. DE-Net, Text2Human, and StyleMC take Image Captions, Modify Instructions, and the original image as input to generate the edited image "}
{"prompt": "After generating images using these four models, we filter them using the ", "completion": "CLIP-based metric that measures the similarity change between the original and edited images "}
{"prompt": "This approach maximizes the reduction of noise in the dataset and ensures data quality. Finally, after filtering, we obtain a total of 6468 pairs of original image-text and edited image-text pairs, which satisfies the requirements ", "completion": "of common open-domain image editing tasks. 3.2 Construction of Dialogue and Image Editing Models The Construction of Dialogue and Image Editing Models module consists of two parts: Dialogue Model Construction and Image Editing Model Construction "}
{"prompt": "We fine-tuned the BlenderBot and Stable Diffusion models, ", "completion": "respectively, on our newly generated Dialogue Editing dataset "}

{"prompt": "This is achieved through a single or multiple rounds of dialogue, resulting in a clear instruction that guides ", "completion": "the image editing module. To accomplish this task, we fine-tuned the Blender dialogue model (Roller et al., 2021) "}
{"prompt": "The response generation is formulated as maximizing the probability of generating a response given the prompt, which can be expressed as: P(response|prompt) = Yn i=1 P(wi |w<i, prompt) (2) where wi denotes the i-th word in the response, w<i denotes the words before ", "completion": "wi , and n is the length of the response. During training, we minimize the negative loglikelihood loss: L = \u2212 log P(response|prompt) (3) To fine-tune our model for the task, we utilized our own dialogue dataset consisting of multi-turn dialogues for image editing "}
{"prompt": "The objective of finetuning is to generate high-quality responses given a ", "completion": "dialogue history x, with the aim of producing explicit editing instructions "}
{"prompt": "Response generation is formulated as maximizing the probability of generating a response y given a dialogue history x, which can be expressed as: arg max y P(y|x) = arg max y Y T t=1 P(yt |y<t, x) (4) where T is the length ", "completion": "of the generated response, and y<t denotes the previously generated tokens. 3.2.2 Image Editing Model Construction Our image editing model is fine-tuned based on the Stable Diffusion model (Hertz et al., 2022) to perform image editing according to explicit instructions from a dialogue model "}
{"prompt": "We use the diffusion model to fine-tunes a pre-trained stable diffusion model on an image editing dataset to ", "completion": "learn a network that predicts the noise to be added to the latent image based on text instructions "}
{"prompt": "Specifically, we minimize the following diffusion target: L = EE(x),E(cI ),cT ,\u000f\u223cN (0,1),t [k\u000f \u2212 \u000f\u03b8 (zt , t, E (cI ), cT )) k 2 2 (5) Figure 5: Model Architecture for Dialogue-Based Image Editing ", "completion": "Here, E and D are the encoder and decoder of a pre-trained variational autoencoder in the stable diffusion model, x is the input image, cI is the image adjustment, and cT is the text instruction adjustment "}
{"prompt": "Unconditional diffusion guidance was also introduced, using two guidance scales sI and sT to ", "completion": "adjust the trade-off between the correspondence with the input image and the editing instruction "}
{"prompt": "The modified score estimation is given as follows. e\u02dc\u03b8 (zt , cI , cT ) =e\u03b8 (zt , \u2205, \u2205) + sI \u00b7 (e\u03b8 (zt , cI , \u2205) \u2212 e\u03b8 (zt , \u2205, \u2205)) + sT \u00b7 ", "completion": "(e\u03b8 (zt , cI , cT ) \u2212 e\u03b8 (zt , cI , \u2205)) (6) 4 Experiments 4.1 Experimental Setup We applied our model on two sets of data: 10,000 dialogue samples and 6,468 filtered image editing samples "}
{"prompt": "For the dialogue model, we used 9,000 samples ", "completion": "for training, 500 for validation, and 500 for testing "}
{"prompt": "For the image editing model, we used 5,868 samples ", "completion": "for training, 300 for validation, and 300 for testing "}

{"prompt": "For Stable Diffusion, we set the batch size to 32, input image size to 256, and ", "completion": "kept the diffusion model configuration and no-classifier guidance algorithm the same as in the original paper "}
{"prompt": "We fine-tuned the model for 125 epochs. Finally, we fixed the parameters of the fine-tuned dialogue and image editing models and connected them according to the architecture shown in Figure 5, resulting in the implementation of our dialoguebased image editing system. 4.2 Qualitative ", "completion": "Analysis of Experimental Cases In order to evaluate the performance of our proposed dialog-based image editing model, we compared it to InstructPix2Pix, which is the baseline model in this paper, under the same precise singleturn instructions, and compared the results of the two models "}
{"prompt": "It can be observed that for InstructPix2Pix, when the input image undergoes significant transformations, the model exhibits ", "completion": "overfitting problems, resulting in the loss of fine-grained background information from the original scene when changing the scene "}
{"prompt": "For DialogPaint, the model can retain fine-grained background information while Figure 6: Comparison of ", "completion": "Performance between DialogPaint and InstructPix2Pix under Same Precise Editing Instructions completing the image transformation "}
{"prompt": "In addition, for InstructPix2Pix, the model ", "completion": "has difficulty isolating the specified object "}
{"prompt": "For example, when given the instruction \"Just turn eyes blue\" the model cannot isolate the specified object, ", "completion": "resulting in not only the eyes of the person but also a corner of their clothing becoming blue "}
{"prompt": "When using DialogPaint, better object isolation can be achieved. We attribute the model\u2019s ability to ", "completion": "the facts that we avoid over-fitting and isolate specified objects in the dataset we provided "}
{"prompt": "Our dataset contained more fine-grained images, and the descriptions were clearer, making it easier for the model to learn fine-grained knowledge and achieve precise ", "completion": "transformation. To further verify the ability of our proposed dialogue-based image editing model, we conducted multiple rounds of dialogue-based testing, as shown in Figure 7 "}
{"prompt": "In Figure 7a, we started with a fashion image and changed the color of different ", "completion": "parts of the person\u2019s body and clothing, and added items to the image, achieving continuous editing "}

{"prompt": "Although our method can achieve image editing through dialog by providing explicit instructions, removing ambiguous instructions, summarizing context, and making stylistic, color, and other changes to the image, there are still ", "completion": "some limitations.
