0,"Q: What is the key architecture of dialogue-based image editing model?
A: ","
The key architecture of a dialogue-based image editing model typically consists of three main components: a natural language processing (NLP) module, a vision module, and a dialogue manager. The NLP module is responsible for understanding the userâ€™s input and extracting relevant information from it. The vision module is responsible for performing the actual image editing operations, such as cropping, resizing, and color adjustment. Finally, the dialogue manager is responsible for managing the conversation between the user and the system, and for providing feedback to the user.","The key architecture of dialogue-based image editing model is shown in Figure 2, which consists of four modules: dialogue generation, image generation, image editing, and image evaluation modules respectively with dotted lines to indicate the connections between them to complete the whole process of dialogue-based image editing with feedback from the user to the model through the dialogue generation module to complete the whole process of dialogue-based image editing with feedback from the user to the model through the dialogue generation module to complete the whole process of dialogue-based image editing with feedback from the user to the model through the dialogue generation module to complete the whole process of dialogue-based image editing with feedback from the user to the model through the dialogue generation module to complete the whole process of dialogue-based image editing with feedback from the user to the model through the dialogue generation module to complete the whole process of dialogue-based image editing with feedback from the user to the model through the dialogue generation module to complete the whole process of dialogue-based image editing with feedback from the user to the model through the dialogue generation module to complete the whole process of dialogue-based image editing with feedback from the user to the model through the dialogue generation module to complete the whole process of dialogue-based image editing with feedback from the user to the model through the dialogue generation module to complete the whole process of dialogue-based image editing with feedback from the user to the model through the dialogue generation module to complete the whole process of dialogue-based image editing with feedback from the user to the model through the dialogue generation module to complete the whole process of dialogue-based image editing with feedback from the user to the model through the dialogue generation module to complete the whole process of dialogue-based image editing with feedback from the user to the model through the dialogue generation module to complete the whole process of dialogue-based image editing with feedback from the user to the model through the dialogue generation module to complete the whole process of dialogue-based image editing with feedback from the user to the model through the dialogue generation module"
